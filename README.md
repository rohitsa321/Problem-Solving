## Problems from NPTEL assignments
    
1. To find the perimeter and area of a circle given a value of radius.You should use Math.PI constant in your program.If radius is zero       or less than zero then print " please enter non zero positive number ".<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/problemsolving/commit/aa1ecc68ee686427b49a7c02251eb8e9fa7a1734">Code(java)</a>

### Pattern

6. Write a program that reads in a number n and prints out n rows each containing n star characters, '*'. 
Thus if n is 3, then your program should print
   [ * * *]
   [ * * *]
   [ * * *]
