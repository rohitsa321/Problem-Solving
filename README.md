## Problems from NPTEL assignments
    
1. To find the perimeter and area of a circle given a value of radius.You should use Math.PI constant in your program.If radius is zero       or less than zero then print " please enter non zero positive number ".<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/problemsolving/blob/master/nptelq1">Code(java)</a>

2. To find the largest among three numbers x, y, and z. You should use if-then-else.<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/problemsolving/blob/master/nptelq2">code(java)</a>
3. To calculate sum of  all these numbers divisible by 3 . Print the sum.<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/problemsolving/blob/master/nptelq3">code(java)</a> Example:
      Input: n = 5,
      0 2 4 6 8
      Even number divisible by 3:0 6
      sum:6
4. Check whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/problemsolving/blob/master/nptelq4">code(java)</a>

7. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first    10 terms will be:

   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
   
   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/problemsolving/blob/master/ProjectEq7">code(c++)</a>
