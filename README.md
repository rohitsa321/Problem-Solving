1. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first    10 terms will be:

   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
   
   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/Problem-Solving/blob/master/ProjectEuler_Q1.cpp">code(c++)</a>

2. The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/Problem-Solving/blob/master/ProjectEuler_Q2.java">code(java)</a>

3. The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
   What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/Problem-Solving/blob/master/ProjectEq3.cpp">code(c++)</a>
   
4. A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
   Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/Problem-Solving/blob/master/ProjectEq4.cpp">code(c++)</a>

5. 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
   What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/Problem-Solving/blob/master/ProjectEq5.cpp">code(c++)</a>
  
6. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
   1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385

   The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
   (1+2+...+10)^2=552=3025

   Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers    and the square of the sum is 3025−385=2640.
 
    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural     numbers and the square of the sum.<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/Problem-Solving/blob/master/ProjectEq6.cpp">code(c++)</a>
    
7. By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the      6th prime is 13.

    What is the 10 001st prime number?<a href="https://github.com/rohitsa321/Problem-Solving/blob/master/ProjectEq7.cpp">code(c++)</a>
    
8. The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are    9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.

9. A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
   a2 + b2 = c2
   For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

   There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
